# Neptune (Anticheat)
#### OVERVIEW
Neptune is a **work-in-progress** anticheat with many checks designed to patch various cheats/hacks. The goal of this project is to provide a free anticheat solution for servers that automatically punishes any player that uses any form of cheat.
#### SUPPORT  
Project is open-sourced and therefore all support will be handled on issues page.\
You can also contact me on Discord: shura62#8896
#### FEATURES
Neptune detections are constantly tested and updated. We want to make sure that your legit playerbase is not affected while still actively punishing cheaters.\
\
Neptune does not effect gameplay while checking for cheats or after cheat is detected so that your legit players games are not interrupted by Neptune.
#### RETRICTIONS
Neptune tries to enforce "default Minecraft" mechanics, therefore any vanilla modifications will most-likely be detected by the anticheat as a cheat.\
Limitations:
* Any plugin that modifies vanilla mechanics (e.g. Custom Enchants).
* PocketMine forks (untested)
#### COMMANDS
* ```/neptune alerts``` - Toggle alerts from the anticheat
* ```/neptune delay <delay>``` - Receive alerts within a specific delay
#### CONFIGURATION
Neptune provides 100% configurable detections. You can enable/disable a specific check, set a maximum violations threshold for them and allow the check to punish players when reached that limit.
